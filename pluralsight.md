### Pluralsight
The following command can be used to download courses from Pluralsight for offline viewing .mp4 format, along with the thumbnails from
the website, subtitles, and descriptions.

It's currently free (April 2020) to register and account, otherwise you're limited to "10 days or 200 minutes of content on Pluralsight's technology learning platform."

```sh
course="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/docker-containers-big-picture"
useragent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36"
youtube-dl -v --cookies cookies.txt --user-agent "$useragent" --add-header Referer:"https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/" -r 20K -o "%(playlist)s/%(chapter_number)s - %(chapter)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s" --sleep-interval 120 --max-sleep-interval 180 --all-subs --embed-subs --add-metadata --embed-thumbnail "$course" --playlist-start 1
```

### Generate a version of youtube-dl with extended wait times
If you're trying to resume a partial download, then it's possible to reach the cap when youtube-dl moves quickly from one already downloaded file to another. In order to avoid that, we can modify the following line to add an extra delay: https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/youtube_dl/extractor/pluralsight.py#L396 and rebuild the application.
``` sh
git clone https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl.git
cd youtube-dl
sed -i 's/random.randint(2, 5)/random.randint(60, 120)/g' youtube_dl/extractor/pluralsight.py
make youtube-dl
mv youtube-dl youtube-dl-ps
```
Then move this new file (youtube-dl-ps) to wherever you want it, and replace the regular command from youtube-dl to ./youtube-dl-ps
